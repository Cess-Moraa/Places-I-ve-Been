# Places I've Been 🌍
---
## Project Description
Places I’ve Been is a simple JavaScript web application that lets users keep track of all the places they have visited. Each destination is represented as a Place object with properties like location, landmarks, season, and notes. Users can:
   - Add new places
   - View details by clicking a place name
   - Delete a place from the list

This project demonstrates JavaScript constructors, prototypes, and test-driven development (TDD). The UI updates dynamically using JavaScript DOM manipulation.
